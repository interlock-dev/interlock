# interlock

Interlock — deterministic governance gate for AI-agent pull requests (protected paths + tiered
merge rules from one interlock.yml). The product reads `interlock.yml`, classifies each changed
file, and posts a sticky PR comment with the tier verdict and merge eligibility.

## Language

The ubiquitous language of this project — one canonical term per concept, defined so a new
teammate (or agent) reads the same meaning everyone else does. Add terms as they crystallise.
Keep this a **glossary only**: no implementation details, no decisions (decisions live in
`docs/adr/`).

> Changing a definition here is **semantic authority** — a `needs-engineer` proposal, never a
> silent edit (Constitution Article XI). The fleet may sharpen a term; only a human ratifies it.

<!-- Example shape (delete when the first real term lands):

**Term**:
Definition in one or two sentences — what it is, and the boundary that separates it from
neighbouring concepts.
_Avoid_: near-synonyms that mean something else here.
